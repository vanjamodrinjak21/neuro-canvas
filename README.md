## Why NeuroCanvas?

> *"Most note-taking apps want you to **store** thoughts. NeuroCanvas wants you to **grow** them."*

Mind-mapping has been stuck in 2008. Static trees. Lonely canvases. AI tools that generate paragraphs of slop instead of helping you **think**.

NeuroCanvas is built around three convictions:

| | |
|---|---|
| **1. Thinking is spatial.** | Ideas have neighbors. Maps reveal them. |
| **2. AI should be a sparring partner, not a vending machine.** | Expand a node. Branch into counter-arguments. Find the missing piece. |
| **3. Knowledge compounds when it's connected.** | Every node you draw becomes part of a personal vector index. The more you map, the smarter your future maps get. |

It runs everywhere you do — web, native desktop, iOS, Android — and it does so without compromise on speed, polish, or privacy.

---

## What it does

- **Infinite canvas** with smart snapping, multi-select, keyboard-first navigation, and a live minimap that actually keeps up with you.
- **AI-powered ideation.** Click any node and ask the AI to expand it, find counter-arguments, summarize a subtree, or generate an entire map from a one-line prompt. Multi-provider: **Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter** — your keys, server-side encrypted vault, never in the browser.
- **True real-time collaboration** via **Yjs CRDT + PartyKit**. No "merge conflict" dialogs, no last-writer-wins. Edits are conflict-free at the data structure level. Roles: viewer / commenter / editor.
- **Semantic recall.** Every node is embedded with `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` (256-d) and indexed in **pgvector** with HNSW. Ask *"where did I write about X?"* and get exact hits across every map you've ever made — locally on desktop via ONNX runtime, server-side everywhere else.
- **Offline-first on desktop.** Tauri + bundled ONNX model = a local LLM that works on a plane.
- **Bilingual at the core.** EN and HR are first-class — UI, docs, and AI prompts are locale-aware. Croatian isn't bolted on; it's a peer.
- **Native shells, single codebase.** Web (Nuxt), Desktop (Tauri 2 / Rust), iOS + Android (Capacitor 8). One canvas engine, four platforms.

## A typical session

```
1.  You sketch a rough map of a new idea — five nodes.
2.  You select the root and type:  "expand into the 5 hardest objections"
3.  AI streams 5 counter-argument nodes in your style and language.
4.  You drag a colleague into the share modal — viewer, commenter, or editor.
5.  Their cursor appears live.  You're now thinking together, in real time.
6.  A week later, you're on a different map.  You search "objection".
7.  Semantic search surfaces the original node.  You drag it onto the new canvas.
8.  Knowledge — connected.
```

## Roadmap

| Phase | Status | What |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | ✅ Shipped | Y.Doc backbone — schema, converter, HMAC auth |
| **2** | ✅ Shipped | PartyKit realtime + JWT presence |
| **3** | ✅ Shipped | Share CRUD + role-based access |
| **4** | ✅ Shipped | `mapStore` ↔ Y.Doc bridge |
| **5** | 🔜 Next | **Desktop release pipeline** — code-signed Tauri builds for macOS (notarized), Windows (Authenticode), and Linux (AppImage + .deb), shipped through a single tag-triggered GitHub Actions workflow with auto-update channels |
| **6** | 🔜 Next | **Public REST + WebSocket API** — stable, versioned endpoints for maps, nodes, embeddings, and live collab; OpenAPI 3.1 spec, scoped API tokens, and a generated TypeScript SDK so third-party tools can read, write, and listen to canvases |

## Performance principles

- **60fps or it didn't ship.** Canvas pan/zoom uses GPU-composited transforms; no per-frame layout reads.
- **Render only what's visible.** Off-screen nodes are virtualised. A 5,000-node map runs as smoothly as a 50-node one.
- **Real-time without the lag.** PartyKit edge nodes keep latency under 60ms for 95% of sessions.
- **Offline doesn't mean "broken."** Tauri ships with the model. The mobile shell ships with IndexedDB-backed sync.

---

## Security stance

> The cheapest bug is the one that never made it past code review.

- All AI provider keys live in a **per-user AES-GCM vault** — never the client, never logs, never URLs.
- Every API route is **auth-gated by default**; public routes are explicit, listed in `server/middleware/`.
- **Zod at every boundary.** Rate-limited where it matters.
- Realtime channels are **HMAC-JWT** scoped to (share, role, expiry).
- Routine secret-scan + dependency audit in CI; vulnerability disclosure handled privately.

Found something? **Don't open a public issue** — see the contact note at the bottom.

---

## Philosophy

NeuroCanvas is opinionated software. It assumes:

- You'd rather **see** an idea than read a paragraph about it.
- AI should **disappear** when you're flowing and **show up** when you're stuck.
- Latency is a feature. Polish is a feature. Typography is a feature.
- Tools shape thought. We're trying to shape it well.

We don't build for the median user. We build for the person who wants their tools to *keep up with* their thinking — not the other way around.
